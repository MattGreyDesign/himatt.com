I"^<p>I am in the process of creating a resource with information about my fonts
here â€” this will include licenses, release details, version history,
technical support and future releases.</p>

<p>For now you can find some of my fonts and their details on
<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/">Myfonts</a>,
<a href="https://www.fontspring.com/foundry/matt-grey-design">Fontspring</a>,
and <a href="http://www.dafont.com/matt-grey.d3130">Dafont</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about any past or future purchases and commissions,
please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
