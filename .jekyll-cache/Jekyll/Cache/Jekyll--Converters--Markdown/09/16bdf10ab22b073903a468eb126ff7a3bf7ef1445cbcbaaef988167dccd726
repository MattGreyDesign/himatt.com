I"B<p>Find My Bus is one of the UK’s first live bus tracking apps. The aim is to
give bus passengers a better idea of when their bus will be at their stop by
using GPS and bus route data combined to provide a more connected experience.</p>

<p>My role as lead designer included creating brand guidelines and marketing
material, designing the app’s user interface and user experience for the
desktop, mobile site and mobile app. I developed the prototype app
architecture and interface including the look, user flows and notifications,
including sounds and haptic feedback.</p>
