I"B<p>Style kit is a digital styleguide for a luxury international hotel and resort
chain based in Toronto. The aim of the project was to provide re-usable styles
and components for developers across a multitude of projects, both internal
and outsourced.</p>

<p>The need for a visual language guide became apparent when it came to
rebranding the whole digital presence, both internally and externally. The
inconsistency that arose from initiating new projects with no reference for
identity meant that a universal resource was in urgent need.</p>

<p>I set out common taxonomies for elements and coded the frontend markup and
styles required, tuning and perfecting the micro-interactions in the process.
The project was a marked success, efficiently being used across the world by a
multitude of development teams across platforms.</p>
