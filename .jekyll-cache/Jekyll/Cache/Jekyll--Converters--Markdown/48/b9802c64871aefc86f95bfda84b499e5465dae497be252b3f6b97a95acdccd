I"<p>A project to design a catalogue for graduates of the Textile Design course
(2013) at Falmouth University. I was asked to create something that did not
favour any one graduate’s work over another. For the cover I came up with the
idea of using fine set typography and different tactile materials like clear
acetate and a varying thickness of paper — without actually showing any work
— to create a delicate sense of texture and layering, which mirrors the
delicate weave and material of textile work.</p>
