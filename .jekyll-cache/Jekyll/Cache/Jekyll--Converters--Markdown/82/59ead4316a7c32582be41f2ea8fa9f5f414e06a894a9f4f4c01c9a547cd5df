I"h<p>The Saatchi gallery is revered for its ability to introduce almost unknown
artists into the public eye; the careers of Damien Hirst and Tracy Emin were
launched from the exposure Saatchi gave them and the gallery boasts the
largest private collection of artwork in the world.</p>

<p>Over the years the gallery has retained itâ€™s success but has never gained a
larger public audience, partly down to not having a consistent brand attached
to it; a disjointed mix of different logos and related imagery from the
various outlets (in-gallery, online and magazine) has diluted the potential of
the Saatchi name.</p>
