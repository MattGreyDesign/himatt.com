I"0<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Grey, a multi-disciplined designer particularly focussed around
digital product design, user experience (UX) and usability. I aim to bridge
the gap between design and technical implementation by working alongside
developers to prototype and deliver products with engaging user experiences.</p>

<p>I currently live and work in Central London as a Product Designer (UX/UI) at
<a href="//www.acuris.com/">Acuris</a>.</p>

<p>Before that I was a UI/UX designer across online shopping at
<a href="//www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>. I worked on the mobile apps and website for
groceries, mobile phones ecommerce site and the company-wide design libraries.</p>

<p>Prior to that I was working in Southampton as a Designer and Consultant at
<a href="//alliants.com">Alliants</a> where I worked with clients such as
<a href="//fourseasons.com">Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts</a>,
<a href="//travelodge.co.uk">Travelodge</a>,
<a href="//skisolutions.com">Ski Solutions</a>,
<a href="//babylonhealth.com">Babylon Health</a>,
<a href="//www.sunlife.com">Sun Life Financial (Canada)</a>,
<a href="//www.specsavers.co.uk/contact-lenses/coopervision">CooperVision/Specsavers</a>,
<a href="//channel5.com">Channel 5</a>,
<a href="//itunes.apple.com/gb/app/butterfly-life/id1258575969">butterfly.life</a>,
<a href="//www.visitbritain.com/gb/en">VisitBritain</a>,
and <a href="//www.openjawtech.com">OpenJaw Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>I design and prototype multi-platform websites and apps, sometimes developing
branding and living styleguides if necessary. In the past I have also worked
in print and illustration, producing album artwork, brochures and books.</p>

<p>In 2010 I founded a <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/">font foundry</a>,
which has released a number of free and commercial <a href="/fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
