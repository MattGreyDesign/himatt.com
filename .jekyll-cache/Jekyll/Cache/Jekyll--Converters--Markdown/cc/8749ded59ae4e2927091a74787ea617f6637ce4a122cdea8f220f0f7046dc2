I"k<p>The Sound of Thunder is a handmade book featuring an illustrated exploration
into the experience I had of going to a Mötorhead gig. The design intends to
portray the juxstapostion between the superficial calmness of the venue’s
exterior and the atmosphere of chaos of the events inside by using a mix of
textures, materials, typography and photography.</p>
