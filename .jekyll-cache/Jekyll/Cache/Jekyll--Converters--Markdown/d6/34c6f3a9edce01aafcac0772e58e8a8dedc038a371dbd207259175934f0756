I"³<p>Butterfly is a social networking app which aims at connecting skilled
creatives across any discipline.</p>

<p>One of the most important goals of Butterfly is to provide reassurance to
artists that they still have the rights any work they upload, and that their
privacy is respected.</p>

<p>I created the architecture, data requirements and UX flow of the application,
first making a low fidelity prototype to test with users.</p>
