I"X<p>The absence of full mobile device support was negatively impacting on
Ski Solutionâ€™s conversions and search engine rankings considerably. The site
at the time had a separate mobile site with a stripped down feature-set. The
solution was to create a fully redesigned responsive experience and optimise
the website from the bottom up to improve SEO and drive enquiries.</p>

<p>Working from a mobile first approach, I redesigned the site to work across
mobile, tablet and desktop, creating a CSS framework and icon font to maintain
consistency with the colours, geometry and component styles.</p>
