The idea for Kunst was seeded by a visit to Amsterdam back in 2014, where I met
up with [David Quay](//davidquaydesign.com/), a type designer and
co-founder of [The Foundry](//www.fontshop.com/foundries/the-foundry).
David was responsible for digitising legendary designer
[Wim Crouwel](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9fCoDfir0)'s classic typeface
[Gridnik](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridnik), of which Kunst was partially
inspired by.

Influenced by queues from a European brutalist design aesthetic, Kunst strives
for form dominated by pure geometric precision, utilising 45° angles based on a
strict grid. The name "Kunst" is a word for art in Estonian, Danish, Dutch,
German, and Norwegian languages.
