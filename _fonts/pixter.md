Inspiration for Pixter initially grew from old computer bitmap fonts, but
branched out into Swiss and Dutch graphic design, such as the graphic work of
Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann and typography of Wim Crouwel.

Pixter straddles the lines between the extreme forms of grid based pixel fonts,
and more conventional grotesque fonts. Its array of styles create a palette of
textures to work with multiple scenarios, from large format display to oversized
passages of copy.
