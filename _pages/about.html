intro: |
  Hi, I'm Matt Grey, a multi-disciplined designer particularly focussed around
  Digital Product design, User Experience (UX) and Usability. I aim to bridge
  the gap between design and technical implementation by working alongside
  developers to deliver products with engaging user experiences.

  I currently live and work in Central London as a UI/UX designer for
  [Tesco](//www.tesco.com/).

  Before that I was working in Southampton as a UX designer and Consultant at
  [Alliants](http://alliants.com) where I worked with clients such as
  <!-- [Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts](//fourseasons.com), -->
  [Travelodge](//travelodge.co.uk),
  [Ski Solutions](//skisolutions.com),
  [Babylon Health](//babylonhealth.com),
  [Sun Life Financial (Canada)](//www.sunlife.com),
  [CooperVision/Specsavers](//www.specsavers.co.uk/contact-lenses/coopervision),
  [Channel 5](//channel5.com),
  [butterfly.life](//itunes.apple.com/gb/app/butterfly-life/id1258575969),
  [VisitBritain](//www.visitbritain.com/gb/en),
  and [OpenJaw Technologies](//www.openjawtech.com).

  I design and prototype multi-platform websites and apps, sometimes developing
  branding and living styleguides if necessary. In the past I have also worked
  in print and illustration, producing album artwork, brochures and books.

  In 2010 I founded a [font foundry](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/),
  which has released a number of free and commercial [fonts](/fonts).
