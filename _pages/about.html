intro: |
  Hi, I'm Matt Grey, a multi-disciplined designer particularly focussed around
  digital product design, user experience (UX), and usability. I aim to bridge
  the gap between design and technical implementation by working alongside
  developers to research, prototype and deliver products with effective and
  engaging user experiences.

  I currently work (and live) in Central London as a Product Designer (UX/UI) at
  [Clearscore](//www.clearscore.com/)

  Previously I was at [Acuris](//www.acuris.com/) where I worked on researching
  and designing the search journey for the flagship M&A deals database, and also
  built out a set of complex scalable design libraries to cover the company's
  six divisions.

  Before that I was a UI/UX designer across online shopping at
  [Tesco](//www.tesco.com/). I worked on the native mobile apps and website for
  groceries, a mobile phones ecommerce site, and helped develop the company-wide
  design libraries across the various platforms.

  Prior to that I was working in Southampton as a Designer and Consultant at
  [Alliants](//alliants.com) where I worked with clients such as
  [Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts](//fourseasons.com),
  [Travelodge](//travelodge.co.uk),
  [Ski Solutions](//skisolutions.com),
  [Babylon Health](//babylonhealth.com),
  [Sun Life Financial (Canada)](//www.sunlife.com),
  [CooperVision/Specsavers](//www.specsavers.co.uk/contact-lenses/coopervision),
  [Channel 5](//channel5.com),
  [butterfly.life](//itunes.apple.com/gb/app/butterfly-life/id1258575969),
  [VisitBritain](//www.visitbritain.com/gb/en),
  and [OpenJaw Technologies](//www.openjawtech.com).

  I design and prototype multi-platform websites and apps, sometimes developing
  branding and living styleguides if necessary. In the past I have also worked
  in print and illustration, producing album artwork, brochures and books.

  In 2010 I founded a [font foundry](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/),
  which has released a number of free and commercial [fonts](/fonts).
