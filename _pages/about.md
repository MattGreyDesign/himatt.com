Matt Grey is a multi-disciplined designer, particularly focussed around Product design, User Experience (UX) and Usability.

I currently live and work in Southampton as a UX designer and consultant at [Alliants](http://alliants.com).

I studied Graphic Design at [Falmouth University](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/graphicdesign).

I design multi-platform websites and apps, produce typefaces and develop branding.

I also work with print and illustration on album artwork, brochures and books.

I have an addiction to music.

In my spare time I cycle, climb, travel, ski.
