  I am in the process of creating a resource with information about my fonts
  here, including licenses, release details and technical support.

  For now you can find some of my fonts and their details on
  [Myfonts](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/),
  [Fontspring](https://www.fontspring.com/foundry/matt-grey-design),
  and [Dafont](http://www.dafont.com/matt-grey.d3130)

  If you have any questions about any purchases, feel free to
  [contact me](/contact)
