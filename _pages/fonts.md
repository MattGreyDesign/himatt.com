intro: |
  I am in the process of creating a resource with information about my fonts
  here â€” this will include licenses, release details and technical support.

  For now you can find some of my fonts and their details on
  [Myfonts](https://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Matt_Grey/),
  [Fontspring](https://www.fontspring.com/foundry/matt-grey-design),
  and [Dafont](http://www.dafont.com/matt-grey.d3130).

  If you have any queries about any past or future purchases and commissions,
  please feel free to [contact me](/contact).
