intro: |
  Press to Press is a very large concertina book documenting various archetypal
  typographical styles associated with the subgenres of rock music, in respect
  to vinyl album covers.

  The pages follow a chronological journey through the defining decades of each
  genre, featuring hand crafted typography and lettering in a seamless stream,
  comparing influences and reasoning on the way. The book itself spans almost
  two metres when opened out, and fits into a seven inch sleeve.
