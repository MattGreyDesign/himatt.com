intro: |
  Lotic surface water sites (e.g. creeks) are important resources for 
  localized agricultural irrigation. However, there is concern that 
  microbial contaminants within untreated surface water may be 
  transferred onto irrigated soil and crops.
  
  To evaluate this issue, water samples were collected between January 2017 and August 2018 
  from a freshwater creek used to irrigate kale and radish plants on 
  a small farm in the Mid-Atlantic, United States. In addition, on one 
  sampling date, a field survey was conducted in which additional water 
  and soil samples were collected to assess the viral and bacterial 
  communities pre- and post-irrigation. 
  
  All samples were processed for DNA extracts and shotgun sequenced and 
  the resulting metagenomic libraries were assembled de novo and 
  taxonomic and functional features were assigned at the contig and 
  peptide level.

  I coordinated the computational analysis of the shotgun microbial and
  viral metagenomes.
