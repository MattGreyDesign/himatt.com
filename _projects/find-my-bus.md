intro: |
  Find My Bus is one of the UK's first live bus tracking apps which gives bus
  passengers a better idea of when their bus will be at their stop by using GPS
  and bus route data.

  My role as lead designer included creating brand guidelines and marketing
  material, designing the app's user interface and user experience for the
  desktop, mobile site and mobile app. I developed the prototype app
  architecture and interface including the look, user flows and notifications,
  including sounds and haptic feedback.
