intro: |
  _iYield_ is a tool for calculating and visualising the estimated returns on
  crowd funded property investment.

  To design a responsive interactive tool that could be embedded in franchised
  websites alongside the details of a property.

  The eventual solution involved working alongside a frontend developer to build
  out a comprehensive frontend prototype that could be tested out with real data
  as a proof of concept.

          The biggest challenges faced in shaping the interface and interactions
          were translating the large amount of variable and adjustable
          information and their controls into a usable mobile-friendly interface.
