intro: |
  _iYield_ is a tool for calculating and visualising the estimated returns on
  crowdfunded property investment. This project centred around an interactive
  tool that could be embedded in franchised property websites and sit alongside
  the details of a property to show potential ROI based on market data and
  upfront costs.

  The eventual solution involved working alongside a frontend developer to build
  out a comprehensive frontend prototype that could be tested out with real data
  as a proof of concept.

          The biggest challenges faced in shaping the interface and interactions
          were translating the large amount of variable and adjustable
          information and their controls into a usable mobile-friendly interface.
