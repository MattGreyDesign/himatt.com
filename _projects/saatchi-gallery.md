intro: |
  The Saatchi gallery is revered for its ability to introduce almost unknown
  artists into the public eye; the careers of Damien Hirst and Tracy Emin were
  launched from the exposure Saatchi gave them and the gallery boasts the
  largest private collection of artwork in the world.

  Over the years the gallery has retained it’s success but has never gained a
  larger public audience, partly down to not having a consistent brand attached
  to it; a disjointed mix of different logos and related imagery from the
  various outlets (in-gallery, online and magazine) has diluted the potential of
  the Saatchi name.

  I carried the concept of the institution's cutting-edge nature into reality.
  The Saatchi gallery is known for it’s sometimes controversial art and
  confidence, which I hinted at in the logo by introducing sharp 45° angles
  which give a suggestion of brash menace.

  I wanted to re-imagine the brand to project a more more modern image which
  could comfortably extend across digital and print platforms, from the
  responsive website to promotional items such as posters and banners, as well
  as magazines that I chose to be in the format of newspapers to reflect the
  cutting edge, newsworthy art being displayed within the gallery.
