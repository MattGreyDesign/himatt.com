intro: |
  The lack of responsiveness was negatively impacting on Ski Solution's search
  engine rankings considerably. The solution to improve SEO and drive enquiries
  was to re-design and optimise the website experience from the bottom up.

  Working from a mobile first, I redesigned the site to work across as many
  devices as possible, creating a CSS framework and icon font to maintain
  consistency with the colours, geometry and component styles.
