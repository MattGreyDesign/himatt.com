intro: |
  The lack of responsive functionality across modern devices was negatively
  impacting on Ski Solution's search engine rankings considerably. The solution
  to improve SEO and drive enquiries was to re-design and optimise the website
  experience from the bottom up.

  Working from a mobile first approach, I redesigned the site to work across
  mobile, tablet and desktop, creating a CSS framework and icon font to maintain
  consistency with the colours, geometry and component styles.
