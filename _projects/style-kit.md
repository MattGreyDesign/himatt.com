intro: |
  Style kit is a digital styleguide for a luxury international hotel and resort
  chain based in Toronto. The aim of the project was to provide re-usable styles
  and components for developers across a multitude of projects, both internal
  and outsourced.

  The need for a visual language guide became apparent when it came to
  rebranding the whole digital presence, both internally and externally. The
  inconsistency that arose from initiating new projects with no reference for
  identity meant that a universal resource was an urgent need.
