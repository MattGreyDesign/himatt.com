intro: |
  Unified was created in response to the ever-growing demand for a set of
  universally appropriate icons suitable for projects I work on, both
  commercially and personally.

  Unified is an ongoing project with icons being added constantly, to date there
  are around 500 icons, not all yet available for purchase.

          I developed a design system with a set of rules to ensure the icons
          could be used in a wide range of circumstances — like for different
          cultures, at small sizes and with and without labels. Some of the
          rules include the dimensions and unit measurements, definitions for
          line thickness, and rules like never using text unless absolutely
          necessary.
