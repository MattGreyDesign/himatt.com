## Some things
I am a multi-disciplined designer, particularly focussed around User Experience (UX) and Usability.

I currently live and work as a UX designer in Southampton at [Alliants](http://alliants.com).

I studied Graphic Design at [Falmouth University](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/graphicdesign).

I mainly design multi-platform websites and apps, produce typefaces and develop branding.

I also work with print and illustration. In the past I have worked on album artwork, brochures and books.

I have an addiction to music.

In my spare time I paint, cycle, travel.
